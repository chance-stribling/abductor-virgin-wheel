Learning Vue with this repo.
Shout out to the creator of The Ultimate Vue 3 Tutorial (100% Composition API) at the Laith Academy.
Made a counter app with javascript, them recreated the same application with Vue JS.
The thid part of this project is creating a basic note taking application.

Notes app has the most functionality so far. I have plans of making an actual api so that I can implement CRUD and persist data in a DB.
